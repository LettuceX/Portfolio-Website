        <span><strong>Role:</strong> Lead Systems Designer</span>

<h3>1. The Design Problem</h3>
<p>Players were spamming the "Fireball" ability because it had the highest damage-per-second (DPS), ignoring the melee mechanics entirely. This made combat repetitive and boring.</p>

<div class="highlight-box">
    <strong>My Goal:</strong> Force players to swap weapons every 5 seconds to maintain optimal damage output.
</div>

<h3>2. The Solution: Momentum System</h3>
<p>I designed a "Momentum" resource bar:</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <li><strong>Melee Attacks:</strong> Generate Momentum.</li>
    <li><strong>Ranged Attacks:</strong> Consume Momentum.</li>
    <li><strong>Result:</strong> If a player spams Fireball, they run out of energy and deal 0 damage until they go back into Melee range.</li>
</ul>

    <p style="color: #555;">[ In the future, your YouTube Embed Code goes here ]</p>
</div>

<h3>3. Outcome</h3>
<p>After playtesting, weapon variety usage increased by <strong>40%</strong>. The system is now fully scalable for future weapon types.</p>
